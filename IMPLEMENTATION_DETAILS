Default values: int 0, string "", bool false.
Boolean < operator is defined so that it is true when left operand is false and right operand is true, false otherwise.
Failing an assert aborts the program and prints an error message.
For loop control variables are immutable and their immutability is checked during semantic analysis and runtime. An error is raised if immutability is violated.
